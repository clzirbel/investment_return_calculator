# Investment Return Calculator
Calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) on an investment from a column of dates, a column of money in/out, and a column of balances.  Results show average yearly rate of return from each date with a balance to the most recent date.

The [project website](https://clzirbel.github.io/investment_return_calculator/) shows examples, explains the data input format, and explains the output format.
